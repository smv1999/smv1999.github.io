<h2>QUOTES</h2>
<center>
I like to read and create Quotes as well. I am greatly inspired by APJ Abdul Kalam sir's quotes.<br><br>
"Programming can give us both intellectual and emotional satisfaction, because it is a real achievement to master complexity and to establish a system of consistent rules. "<b> - Andrei Ershov</b><br><br>
"The best way to prepare as a programmer is to write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written. In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I fished out listings of their operating system. You’ve got to be willing to read other people’s code, then write your own, then have other people review your code. You’ve got to want to be in this incredible feedback loop where you get the world-class people to tell you what you’re doing wrong."<b> - Bill Gates</b><br><br>
"Man needs his difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success."<b>- APJ Abdul Kalam</b><br><br>
"If you want to shine like a sun,first burn like a sun."<b>- APJ Abdul Kalam</b><br><br>
"Celebrate your birthday not because you were born on that day, but to realise the very purpose of your living." <b>- S M Vaidhyanathan</b></center>
